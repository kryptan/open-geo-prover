# Open Geo Prover #

This is an Open Source project developed in Java for implementation of various Automated Geometry Theorem Provers. It can be used as a stand-alone application but also can be integrated into existing geometry tools.

Of algebraic geometry theorem provers it implements Wu's and Gr√∂bner basis methods.

Automated geometry theorem provers should help users interested in geometry to:

  * easily check if certain relationships among constructed geometry objects are satisfied;
  * better understand the complexity of various geometry theorems by examining the complexity of automated proving;
  * find new relationships among constructed geometry objects and therefore eventually find new geometry theorems;
  * explore in more details various techniques of automated geometry theorem proving by reading detailed proving reports;
  * examine non-degenerative (NDG) conditions and therefore consider special cases of geometry theorems.
