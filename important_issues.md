# Important issues of OGP project by development branch/baseline and stage of work on a specific branch #


## Main development trunk ##

### A-stage (Initial development work) ###
  * [issue 1](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=1): Execution of JUnit tests from Ant build file. It is fixed by adding current working directory in junit tag. Consulted Apache's Ant official page for [junit tag](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html) for help on this work.
  * [issue 2](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=2): Implemented new type of construction - construction of second angle ray for given first ray and congruent angle.
  * [issue 4](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=4): New types of constructions added to the project.
  * [issue 5](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=5): Adding several examples for simple Wu's method.
  * [issue 6](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=6): Project cleanup - removing unnecessary files and folders.
  * [issue 7](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=7): Execution of OGP help from command line.
  * ...

### CON-stage (Support for conic sections) ###
  * [issue 3](https://code.google.com/p/open-geo-prover/issues/detail?id=3): Implementation of basic support for parametric sets.
